Here are the different topics we're going through :
- A little bit of scraping
- NA and Zeros Treatment
- Data Analysis and Visualising thanks to matplotlib and seaborn librairies
- ProfileReport
- apply / np.where functions
- One Hot Encoded
- Standardisation (with Standard Scaler)
- PCA - Principal Component Analysis
- 2 regression models : Linear Regression + KNN Regressor
- 4 classifier models : Logistic Regression + KNN Classifier + Random Forest Classifier + Decision Tree Classifier
- ROC and AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Different measures : accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall, threshold
